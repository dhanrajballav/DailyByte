# Daily Questions

This directory contains all the daily coding challenge problems for the DailyByte community.

## Problem Format

Each problem is stored in a separate markdown file following the naming convention:
- `day1-problem.md`
- `day2-problem.md`
- `day3-problem.md`
- etc.

## Problem Structure

Each problem file includes:

1. **Problem Title and Difficulty**
2. **Problem Statement**: Clear description of what needs to be solved
3. **Examples**: Multiple test cases with inputs and expected outputs
4. **Constraints**: Limits and assumptions for the problem
5. **Follow-up**: Additional challenges or optimization questions
6. **Hints**: Expandable hints to help if you're stuck
7. **Submission Guidelines**: How to submit your solution
8. **Deadline**: When the solution is due

## How to Use

1. **Check Daily**: New problems are posted daily
2. **Read Carefully**: Understand the problem completely before coding
3. **Plan First**: Think about your approach before implementing
4. **Code**: Implement your solution in your preferred language
5. **Test**: Verify with all provided examples
6. **Submit**: Follow the submission guidelines in the main README

## Problem Difficulty Levels

- 🟢 **Easy**: Fundamental concepts, straightforward implementation
- 🟡 **Medium**: Requires problem-solving skills, multiple approaches possible
- 🔴 **Hard**: Complex algorithms, optimization required

## Tips for Success

### Before Coding:
- Read the problem 2-3 times
- Identify input and output formats
- Note the constraints
- Think about edge cases
- Plan your approach on paper

### While Coding:
- Start with a brute force solution
- Think about optimization
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Test as you code

### After Coding:
- Test with all examples
- Think about edge cases
- Analyze time and space complexity
- Check if optimization is possible
- Review your code for clarity

## Common Problem Categories

You'll encounter various types of problems:
- **Arrays & Strings**: Manipulation, searching, sorting
- **Hash Maps**: Frequency counting, lookups
- **Two Pointers**: Efficient array traversal
- **Sliding Window**: Substring/subarray problems
- **Recursion & Backtracking**: Tree traversal, combinations
- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimization problems
- **Graphs & Trees**: Traversal, pathfinding
- **And more!**

## Learning Resources

If you're stuck or want to learn more:
- Review the hints (but try to solve first!)
- Study the approach, not the code
- Discuss concepts (not solutions) with peers
- Draw diagrams to visualize the problem
- Break down the problem into smaller parts

## Academic Integrity

Remember:
- These problems are for YOUR learning
- Don't use AI tools to generate solutions
- Don't copy from online sources
- Understand every line of code you write
- It's okay to struggle - that's how you learn!
