# Answers Directory

This directory contains all student solutions for the DailyByte challenges.

## Structure

Each student should create their own subdirectory with their name:

```
answers/
├── sample-solutions/          # Reference solutions (DO NOT COPY!)
├── john-doe/                  # Student folder example
│   ├── day1-solution.py
│   ├── day2-solution.js
│   └── ...
└── jane-smith/                # Another student folder
    ├── day1-solution.cpp
    └── ...
```

## Naming Convention

- **Folder name**: Use your name in lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `john-doe`, `jane-smith`)
- **File name**: `day<number>-solution.<extension>`
  - Example: `day1-solution.py`, `day2-solution.js`, `day3-solution.cpp`

## Supported Languages

You can use any programming language you're comfortable with:
- Python (`.py`)
- JavaScript (`.js`)
- Java (`.java`)
- C++ (`.cpp`)
- C (`.c`)
- Go (`.go`)
- Ruby (`.rb`)
- And many more!

## Solution Format

Your solution file should include:

1. **Header Comment**: Include your name, date, and problem description
2. **Approach Explanation**: Describe your algorithm/approach
3. **Complexity Analysis**: State time and space complexity
4. **Well-Commented Code**: Explain key logic points
5. **Test Cases**: Include the examples from the problem

### Example Template (Python):

```python
"""
Day X: Problem Name - Solution
Author: Your Name
Date: YYYY-MM-DD

Problem: [Brief problem description]

Approach: [Your approach]
- [Key point 1]
- [Key point 2]

Time Complexity: O(?)
Space Complexity: O(?)
"""

def solution_function(params):
    # Your implementation
    pass

# Test cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test the examples
    pass
```

## Important Notes

⚠️ **DO NOT COPY** from the `sample-solutions/` folder! These are reference solutions meant to show you the expected format and code quality. Your learning comes from solving problems yourself.

✅ **DO**:
- Write your own solution from scratch
- Comment your code clearly
- Test with all provided examples
- Explain your thought process
- Ask for help if stuck on concepts

❌ **DON'T**:
- Copy solutions from anywhere (including sample-solutions/)
- Use AI tools to generate code
- Submit incomplete or untested solutions
- Plagiarize from other students

## Questions?

If you have questions about:
- Problem understanding → Open an issue or ask in the community
- Submission process → Check the main README.md
- Code errors → Debug first, then ask for help on concepts (not solutions)

Happy coding! Remember, the goal is to learn and improve your skills. 🚀
